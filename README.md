List of hi-tech companies in Israel along with the location of their development offices
and if possible along with a list of technologies they are using.

Companies are in the [companies.json](data/companies.json). Before committing, please run `./tidy_json.py`.

Each company has the following entry:


```
    {
        "name": "",
        "url": "",
        "technologies" : [],
        "offices": [
            {
                "area" : "",
                "address": "",
                "phone" : "",
                "coordinates": {
                    "lat": 0,
                    "lng": 0
                }
            }
        ]
    },
```

Where "technologies" should be a list of technologies used in the company. E.g. JavaScript, Python, Java, Docker, MySQL, AngularJS.
The list of technologies can be found in the [technologie.json](data/technologies.json) file. It serves us a way to check we don't
make typos and we don't have different spellings of the same thing.  Update that file too if you'd like to list another technology.

"area" is one of the following areas. (TODO: unify the words used in the field. Create a JSON file of all the areas with descriptions where there might be ambiguity. Script to verify we use only the arease defined in that file.)

https://www.gps-coordinates.net/ can be used to convert addresses to coordinates.
